# MetadataTool
This repository hosts code for the tool used to generate metadata to be used on GNPS

When working on linux you will need to install tkinter by running

<i>sudo apt-get install python3-tk</i>

in the terminal. Tkinter comes as default with the windows distribution of Python so no extra work is needed to develop on that platform

You will also need to install Pillow for displaying the WACL logo, which can be done by running

<i>python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow</i>

This needs to be done for either distribution of Python
